mciutil is distributed as a python package.

You will need a version of python installed to run the tool.

Python version 2.6, 2.7 or 3.4 and above are supported.

See https://www.python.org/downloads for instructions on installing python on
your required platform.

Once you have Python available, at the command line enter::

    $ virtualenv mciutil
    $ source ./mciutil/bin/activate
    $ pip install mciutil

For Windows platforms::

    c:> virtualenv mciutil
    c:> ./mciutil/Scripts/activate

If you start another command prompt after installing, you can
make the commands available in the new session by activating the
python environment::

    $ source ./mciutil/bin/activate

or for windows::

    c:> ./mciutil/Scripts/activate
